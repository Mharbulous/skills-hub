# AR Follow-Up

Produce a prioritized list of clients who need a money conversation, consolidating all outstanding amounts into a single ask per client, timed to the court calendar.

## Design Principles

Read `vision.md` for the full design philosophy. The five principles that govern every output:

1. **One Conversation, One Number** — Never surface a client for just one component when other amounts are outstanding. Consolidate invoices + WIP + retainer shortfall + court-date increases into one total.
2. **Time the Ask to the Calendar** — Prioritize by court date proximity, not amount owed.
3. **Suppress During Clearing** — When payment-in-flight is recorded, suppress all reminders for that client until cleared or expired.
4. **Advise on Policy, Not Exceptions** — State what retainer policy requires. Never advise whether to make exceptions.
5. **Show the Math** — Every recommendation cites its components so the practitioner can verify before calling.

## Data Sources (Read-Only)

This skill reads from upstream skills via `/practice-data`. It does not own or modify upstream data.

| Source | What it provides |
|--------|-----------------|
| retainer-tracking | Current trust balance per matter |
| wip-tracker | Unbilled WIP hours per matter |
| dates-and-deadlines | Upcoming court dates |
| invoice-tracking | Outstanding invoices |

All data accessed via `/practice-data` operations — this skill never connects to the database directly.

**Graceful degradation:** When upstream data is unavailable (not yet initialized, no rows, or skill not yet implemented), include what is available and note what is missing. Never fail entirely because one source is absent. Example: if no court dates exist, skip calendar-based prioritization and fall back to amount-based ordering, noting "Court date data unavailable — prioritized by amount only."

## Owned State: Payment-in-Flight

This skill owns payment-in-flight tracking via `/practice-data`'s `manage-payment-in-flight` operation. The table is defined in `/practice-data`'s schema.

**If the table does not yet exist in the database:** payment-in-flight recording is unavailable. If the practitioner asks to record a payment-in-flight, explain that this feature requires the database to be re-initialized and skip suppression logic. The AR list still functions — it just cannot suppress clients with pending payments.

### Clearing Window

Default clearing window: **5 business days** from `recorded_at`. The practitioner can override when recording.

A payment-in-flight expires (and the client resurfaces) when:
- The clearing window passes without confirmation, OR
- The next retainer-tracking CSV import shows the deposit (retainer-tracking confirms; this skill does not verify deposits)

## Workflow: Generate AR List

1. Resolve DB path per `practice-data/SKILL.md`
2. Query each data source (see queries below)
3. For each client with any outstanding amount, build a consolidated record
4. Apply payment-in-flight suppression
5. Prioritize the list
6. Present results

### Step 1: Query Data Sources

Invoke `/practice-data` `ar-data` operation to retrieve all non-closed matters with:
- Matter description and identifiers
- Client name and number
- Trust balance and last update date
- WIP hours and entry count
- Payment-in-flight status (amount, recorded date, expected clearing date)

The operation excludes funded matters (only returns depleted or zero-balance). If payment-in-flight data is unavailable, the operation returns results without it — set a flag so suppression logic is skipped.

**Sign convention:** Trust balances are presented as positive numbers to the user. A zero balance means depleted; a non-zero balance means funded. Check the sign convention via `/practice-data`.

### Step 2: Build Consolidated Client Records

Group all data by client. For each client, compute:

| Component | Source | Calculation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Outstanding invoices | invoice-tracking | Sum of unpaid invoice amounts |
| Unbilled WIP | wip-tracker | Total hours × hourly rate (ask practitioner for rate if unknown) |
| Current trust balance | retainer-tracking | Amount currently held in trust |
| Retainer shortfall | Retainer policy | Required retainer minus current trust balance |
| Court-date increase | dates-and-deadlines | Additional retainer required for upcoming hearing/trial |
| **Total ask** | All above | Outstanding invoices + unbilled WIP + retainer shortfall + court-date increase − current trust balance |

If a component is unavailable, omit it from the total and note it in the output.

### Step 3: Retainer Policy Rules

Apply BC litigation retainer policy to determine required retainer level. These defaults reflect typical BC Supreme Court timelines — the practitioner can override any threshold per matter.

| Upcoming event | Default retainer requirement | Request window | Due by | Rationale |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| Trial | Practitioner-defined per matter (no default — ask) | 120+ days before trial | 90 days before trial | 90-day window allows time for withdrawal application if client does not fund; 120-day request gives 30 days for the client to respond and funds to clear |
| Hearing (per day) | $5,000/hearing-day | 28+ days before hearing | 14 days before hearing | 14-day due date allows a 10-business-day clearing window plus buffer; 28-day request gives the client 14 days to act |
| No upcoming dates | $3,000 base retainer (practitioner-adjustable) | When trust reaches $0 | Ongoing | Minimum working retainer to cover routine disbursements and 10-15 hours of work at typical rates |

**When the practitioner has not set a per-matter trial retainer amount:** prompt them to specify one rather than guessing. State: "Trial retainer amount not set for [matter]. What amount should I use for future calculations?"

**Policy advisory** — based on the financial picture, state the applicable policy:

- **Retainer funded, no action needed** — trust balance covers requirements
- **Retainer low, replenishment recommended** — trust balance below required level but work can continue
- **Retainer depleted, policy requires cease work** — `regular_trust = 0`, no payment in flight. State the policy; do not advise on exceptions.
- **Consider withdrawal** — retainer depleted AND client unresponsive to prior requests. State policy only.

### Step 4: Prioritization

Rank clients by urgency, not amount. Calendar proximity always outranks dollar amounts — a $3,000 shortfall with a hearing in 2 weeks outranks a $10,000 balance with no upcoming dates.

| Tier | Criteria | Sort keys (within tier) |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| 1 | Court date within 30 days + retainer shortfall | Days to court date ASC, then total ask DESC |
| 2 | Court date within 120 days + retainer shortfall | Days to court date ASC, then total ask DESC |
| 3 | Retainer depleted ($0 trust), no court date | Total ask DESC |
| 4 | Retainer low (below policy threshold), no court date | Shortfall as % of required DESC |
| 5 | Unbilled WIP only (retainer adequate) | WIP amount DESC |
| 6 | Outstanding invoices only | Invoice age DESC (oldest first) |

**Implementation:** Assign each client a `(tier, sort_key_1, sort_key_2)` tuple and sort once. A single `sorted()` call with this composite key produces the final list — no multi-pass sorting needed.

```python
# Example: tier assignment + sort
def priority_key(client):
    if client['nearest_court_days'] is not None and client['nearest_court_days'] <= 30 and client['shortfall'] > 0:
        return (1, client['nearest_court_days'], -client['total_ask'])
    elif client['nearest_court_days'] is not None and client['nearest_court_days'] <= 120 and client['shortfall'] > 0:
        return (2, client['nearest_court_days'], -client['total_ask'])
    elif client['trust_balance'] == 0:
        return (3, -client['total_ask'], 0)
    elif client['shortfall'] > 0:
        return (4, -client['shortfall_pct'], 0)
    elif client['wip_amount'] > 0:
        return (5, -client['wip_amount'], 0)
    else:
        return (6, -client['invoice_age_days'], 0)

ranked = sorted(clients_with_amounts, key=priority_key)
```

**When court dates are unavailable:** Skip tiers 1-2 entirely and note "Court date data unavailable — prioritized by retainer status and amount only." Clients that would otherwise be tier 1-2 fall to tier 3 or 4 based on their retainer status.

### Step 5: Present Results

```
AR Follow-Up — [Date]
Data as of: trust balances [last_trust_date], WIP [latest time entry date]
[Note any missing data sources]

Priority  Client              Total Ask    Breakdown                           Due By      Policy
───────── ─────────────────── ──────────── ─────────────────────────────────── ─────────── ──────────────────
1         Smith (C1234)       $8,200       $800 invoice + $2,400 WIP +        2026-05-15  Cease work pending
                                           $5,000 trial retainer                          replenishment
2         Doe (C5678)         $5,000       $5,000 hearing retainer            2026-04-28  Replenishment needed
                                           (trust: $0)
3         Jones (C9012)       $3,000       $3,000 base retainer               —           Replenishment needed
                                           (trust: $0, no court dates)

[Suppressed: Lee (C3456) — payment-in-flight $2,500, recorded 2026-04-12, clears by 2026-04-19]
```

Always show the suppressed clients at the bottom so the practitioner knows they exist but are being held.

## Workflow: Record Payment-in-Flight

When the practitioner says a client has sent payment (e.g., "Smith sent an e-transfer for $2,500"):

1. Resolve the matter by client name or number
2. Record to `payment_in_flight`: amount, `recorded_at = now`, `expected_clear_by = now + 5 business days`
3. Confirm: "Recorded: Smith (C1234) — $2,500 payment in flight. Suppressing reminders until [clear-by date]. The next trust CSV import will confirm when it clears."

## Workflow: Check Single Client

When asked "what does Smith owe?" or "financial picture for file L3948":

1. Query all data sources for that client/matter
2. Build the consolidated record (same as Step 2 above)
3. Present the full breakdown with all components and the math

```
Smith (C1234) — File L3948 (Smith v Jones)

Current trust balance:     $0.00 (depleted, as of 2026-04-01)
Outstanding invoices:      $800.00 (Invoice #1234, issued 2026-03-15)
Unbilled WIP:             $2,400.00 (12.0 hrs @ $200/hr)
Retainer required:         $5,000.00 (trial 2026-08-15 — $5,000/day x 1 day)
                          ──────────
Total ask:                 $8,200.00
Due by:                    2026-05-15 (90 days before trial)

Policy: Retainer depleted. Cease work pending replenishment. Trial in 123 days.

Payment-in-flight:         None
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **retainer-tracking** | Provides current trust balances and confirms deposits via CSV import |
| **wip-tracker** | Provides unbilled WIP hours per matter |
| **dates-and-deadlines** | Provides court dates for calendar-based prioritization |
| **invoice-tracking** | Provides outstanding invoice data |
| **practice-data** | Owns schema and path resolution. Payment-in-flight table must be added there. |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Surfacing a client for one component** when other amounts are also outstanding. Always consolidate first.
- **Ranking by amount owed** instead of court date urgency. A $3,000 shortfall with a hearing in 2 weeks outranks a $10,000 balance with no upcoming dates.
- **Sending reminders during clearing.** If payment-in-flight is recorded, suppress that client entirely.
- **Advising on exceptions to policy.** Say "Policy requires cease work" not "You should stop working on this file."
- **Treating absence as zero.** No matter record = retainer status unknown, not depleted. No time entries = WIP unknown, not zero. Flag unknowns explicitly.
- **Querying upstream CSVs directly.** All data comes through the practice database. Never parse accounting CSVs.
