# Time Entry Drafting

Interpret classified time blocks from time-sorting and produce professional time entry descriptions with UTBMS litigation codes. This skill bridges the gap between "which matter was I working on?" (answered by time-sorting) and "what did I do for that matter?" (answered here).

## Pipeline Position

```
build-timeline → time-sorting → time-entry-drafting → invoice-tracking
(raw signals)    (matter assignment)  (descriptions + UTBMS)   (billing)
```

This skill reads from the `timesort` namespace and writes drafts to the `tedraft` namespace. Approved entries are committed to the `time_entries` table in the practice database.

## Design Principles

These four principles govern every decision in this skill. When in doubt, refer back here.

**Never fabricate from insufficient signals.** When the pattern database has no confident match for an activity block, surface the raw signals and ask the practitioner to describe what they were doing. A fabricated description on a client invoice is a professional conduct issue; an honest gap that prompts a quick practitioner input is a minor inconvenience.

**Learn from every correction.** Store practitioner corrections as new entries in the pattern database, linking the activity signals to the description the practitioner provided. Each correction is a labeled training example — the skill's value depends on accumulating these examples so the same correction is never needed twice.

**Description first, code second.** Generate the narrative description before assigning the UTBMS code. The description captures the specific meaning of the work; the UTBMS code categorizes that meaning. Starting with the code constrains the description to fit a predetermined category and produces generic, unhelpful entries.

**Structured descriptions follow legal billing conventions.** Produce descriptions using the standard legal billing pattern: verb phrase + subject + context. These descriptions may appear on client invoices — non-standard or casual phrasing looks unprofessional.

## Data Model

### Input: Time-Sorting Day Object

Read classified activities for the target date:

```bash
cowork-db get timesort "day:{YYYY-MM-DD}"
```

Each activity in the day object provides:
- `id`, `start`, `end` — identity and timing
- `matter` — matter number (e.g. "L3948") or null
- `task_name` — human-readable matter name or null
- `category` — admin category or null
- `activity_type` — screen_work, phone_call, meeting, court, untracked
- `confidence` — high, medium, low
- `attribution.signals` — raw signals (window titles, app names, phone numbers)

Activities with `matter` set are billable. Activities with `category` set are non-billable. Activities with both null are unassigned — flag for practitioner review.

### Output: tedraft Namespace

Draft state, UTBMS metadata, and the pattern database live in cowork-db under the `tedraft` namespace. The practice-data skill owns the `time_entries` table schema, so UTBMS enrichment data is stored separately here.

| Key pattern | Value | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `draft:{YYYY-MM-DD}` | JSON array of draft entries | Pending review |
| `utbms:{YYYY-MM-DD}:{entry_id}` | JSON `{task_code, activity_code}` | UTBMS codes for a committed entry |
| `pattern:{hash}` | JSON pattern object | Signal-to-description mapping |
| `patterns:index` | JSON array of pattern summaries | Fast pattern lookup |
| `config:billing_increment` | Number (default `0.1`) | Hours per billing unit |
| `config:minimum_entry` | Number (default `0.1`) | Minimum billable duration |

### Draft Entry Schema

```json
{
  "id": "d1",
  "matter": "L3948",
  "matter_name": "Smith v Jones",
  "category": null,
  "entry_date": "2026-04-14",
  "source_activities": ["a1", "a2", "a3"],
  "start": "09:02",
  "end": "10:15",
  "raw_hours": 1.22,
  "billed_hours": 1.3,
  "description": "Research law regarding quantum of non-pecuniary damages for ankle injury",
  "utbms_task": "L120",
  "utbms_activity": "A102",
  "description_source": "pattern_match | generated | insufficient",
  "status": "draft | approved | corrected | rejected"
}
```

When `description_source` is `"insufficient"`, the `description` field contains the raw signals instead of a narrative — the practitioner must provide the description.

### Pattern Object Schema

```json
{
  "hash": "sha256 of normalized signal fingerprint",
  "signal_fingerprint": {
    "applications": ["Microsoft Word"],
    "window_title_keywords": ["statement", "claim"],
    "activity_type": "screen_work",
    "matter_context": "litigation"
  },
  "description_template": "Drafting statement of claim",
  "utbms_task": "L120",
  "utbms_activity": "A103",
  "match_count": 5,
  "last_matched": "2026-04-14",
  "created_from_correction": true
}
```

### Schema Dependency

The `time_entries` table in the practice database currently has: `id`, `matter_id`, `entry_date`, `hours`, `description`, `created_at`. This skill needs UTBMS codes per entry but does not own the schema. UTBMS metadata is stored in `tedraft` namespace keys (`utbms:{date}:{entry_id}`) cross-referenced by the `time_entries.id` returned after insertion. If the practice-data schema adds UTBMS columns in the future, this skill should migrate to writing them directly.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Sorted Day

Read the classified day from time-sorting:

```bash
cowork-db get timesort "day:{YYYY-MM-DD}"
```

If the key is absent or empty, tell the practitioner: "No sorted time found for {date}. Run time-sorting for that date first." Do not proceed.

Check the day's summary: if `unassigned_hours` exceeds 20% of `total_hours`, warn the practitioner before proceeding: "{N} hours are unassigned in time-sorting. Draft entries for those periods will be incomplete — consider re-sorting first."

### Step 1: Aggregate Into Billable Blocks

Group consecutive or near-consecutive activities for the same matter (or category) into billable blocks. Two activities belong in the same block when:

1. They share the same `matter` (or both share the same `category` if non-billable)
2. The gap between them is 5 minutes or less

Gaps longer than 5 minutes produce separate time entries — the practitioner likely did something else in between, even if it wasn't captured.

For each block, record:
- Combined `start` (earliest) and `end` (latest)
- Summed `raw_hours` from constituent activities
- Collected `attribution.signals` from all activities (for description generation)
- All source `activity_id`s

Unassigned activities (null matter, null category) become standalone entries with `description_source: "insufficient"`.

### Step 2: Generate Narrative Descriptions

For each billable block, generate a professional description. Process in this order:

**1. Check the pattern database.** Compute the signal fingerprint from the block's collected signals (applications used, window title keywords, activity type). Search `patterns:index` for matches:

```bash
cowork-db get tedraft "patterns:index"
```

If a pattern matches with `match_count >= 3`, use its `description_template` as the base description. Set `description_source: "pattern_match"`.

**2. Interpret signals directly.** If no pattern matches, interpret the raw signals to generate a description. Use the attribution signals — window titles, application names, activity types — to infer the work performed:

- **LEAP + document title** → "Review/revise [document type] in [matter name]"
- **CanLII/Westlaw + Chrome** → "Research law regarding [topic from window titles]"
- **Word + extended session** → "Draft [document type inferred from title]"
- **Phone call + matter context** → "Telephone call with [party] regarding [matter context]"
- **Court calendar event** → "Attend [hearing type] in [matter name]"

Descriptions follow the legal billing pattern: **verb phrase + subject + context**.

Good: "Research law regarding limitation period for personal injury claim"
Good: "Telephone call with client regarding formal offer to settle"
Bad: "Looked at cases about damages"
Bad: "Working on the Smith file"

Set `description_source: "generated"`.

**3. Surface insufficient signals.** If the signals are too ambiguous to produce a confident description (e.g., generic window title "Document1", Chrome tab "Google"), do NOT fabricate. Set `description_source: "insufficient"` and populate `description` with the raw signal summary so the practitioner can see what was captured:

```
[Insufficient signals] Word: "Document1 - Microsoft Word" (45 min), Chrome: "Google" (12 min)
```

The practitioner will provide the description during review.

### Step 3: Assign UTBMS Codes

After generating descriptions (not before), assign UTBMS codes. Read the reference at `references/utbms-litigation.md` for the code tables and signal heuristics.

For each entry:
1. Determine the **activity code** (A-series) from the description verb: research → A102, draft → A103, review → A104, communicate → A106/A107/A108, appear → A109
2. Determine the **task code** (L-series) from the matter context and work type: pre-trial pleading work → L120, discovery → L130, trial prep → L150

When the task code is ambiguous, default to L110 (Case Assessment, Development and Administration) — the broadest category. The practitioner can correct it during review.

For entries with `description_source: "insufficient"`, leave UTBMS codes as null. They will be assigned when the practitioner provides the description.

For non-billable entries (category-based), skip UTBMS assignment entirely.

### Step 4: Round to Billing Increments

Read the billing increment configuration:

```bash
cowork-db get tedraft "config:billing_increment"
```

Default to `0.1` (6-minute increments) if not set. Round each entry's `raw_hours` up to the nearest increment to produce `billed_hours`. Entries below the minimum entry threshold (default `0.1`) are still kept — the practitioner decides whether to bill them.

### Step 5: Store Draft and Present

Build the draft entry array and store it:

```bash
cowork-db set tedraft "draft:{YYYY-MM-DD}" '{draft_json}'
```

Present the draft entries as a table:

```
#  Time         Hours  Description                                           UTBMS     Status
1  09:02-10:15  1.3    Research law regarding quantum of damages              L120/A102  Draft
2  10:15-10:33  0.3    Telephone call with client re: settlement offer        L120/A106  Draft
3  10:33-11:45  1.2    [Insufficient signals] Word: "Document1" (72 min)      —/—        Needs input
4  11:45-12:00  0.3    Email triage and scheduling                            —          Admin
5  13:00-14:30  1.5    Draft reply to application to dismiss                  L120/A103  Draft
```

Below the table, show the summary:
```
Billable: 3.3 hrs across 3 entries | Admin: 0.3 hrs | Needs input: 1 entry
Pattern matches: 2 | Generated: 1 | Insufficient: 1
```

Ask the practitioner to review: "Review the entries above. You can approve all, correct individual descriptions, reject entries, or provide descriptions for entries marked 'Needs input'."

### Step 6: Process Practitioner Review

The practitioner can:

**Approve all:** "Approve all" or "looks good" — commit all draft entries.

**Correct a description:** "Entry 3 was drafting the notice of civil claim" — update the entry's description, assign UTBMS codes based on the new description, set `status: "corrected"`, and learn from the correction (Step 7).

**Correct a UTBMS code:** "Entry 1 should be L150, not L120" — update the code, store the correction for pattern learning.

**Reject an entry:** "Remove entry 4" — set `status: "rejected"`, exclude from commit.

**Modify hours:** "Entry 2 was only 0.1" — update `billed_hours`.

After processing all corrections, re-display the updated table and ask for final approval before committing.

### Step 7: Learn from Corrections

When the practitioner corrects a description or UTBMS code, store the correction as a new pattern (or update an existing one):

1. Extract the signal fingerprint from the corrected entry's `source_activities` — gather the original attribution signals from the timesort day object
2. Compute a normalized hash of the fingerprint (sort keywords, lowercase, deduplicate)
3. Check if a pattern with this hash already exists:

```bash
cowork-db get tedraft "pattern:{hash}"
```

4. If it exists, update `description_template` and increment `match_count`
5. If new, create a pattern object and store it:

```bash
cowork-db set tedraft "pattern:{hash}" '{pattern_json}'
```

6. Update the patterns index:

```bash
cowork-db get tedraft "patterns:index"
# Append or update the entry, then:
cowork-db set tedraft "patterns:index" '{updated_index}'
```

The pattern fingerprint uses normalized, order-independent signals so that "Word + CanLII" matches "CanLII + Word". Keywords are extracted from window titles by stripping common suffixes ("- Google Chrome", "- Microsoft Word") and lowercasing.

### Step 8: Commit Approved Entries

For each approved or corrected entry with a non-null `matter`:

1. Invoke `/practice-data` `matter-lookup` to find the matter by its number. If no matching matter exists, warn the practitioner and skip: "No matter found for {matter} in the practice database. Entry not committed — add the matter first."

2. Invoke `/practice-data` `insert-time-entry` with the matter ID, entry date, billed hours, and description. The operation returns the new entry's ID.

3. Store UTBMS metadata keyed to the database ID:

```bash
cowork-db set tedraft "utbms:{date}:{entry_db_id}" '{"task_code":"L120","activity_code":"A102"}'
```

4. Update the draft status:

```bash
cowork-db set tedraft "draft:{YYYY-MM-DD}" '{updated_draft_with_committed_status}'
```

Non-billable (category-based) entries are not committed to `time_entries` — they exist in the draft for the practitioner's reference only.

Report completion: "Committed {N} time entries for {date}. Total billable hours: {H}."
